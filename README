Reference Implementation of HPL-AI Benchmark

To compile and run:

```
$ make
$ ./driver <n> <max_iter>
```
Where n is the size of linear system to solve.
max_iter is the maximum number of iterations for GMRES iterative solver.

Example output:

```
Residual norm at the beginning of GMRES: 1.176789e-08
Estimated residual norm at the 1-th iteration of GMRES: 7.555386e-15
Estimated residual norm at the 2-th iteration of GMRES: 1.497604e-21
Final backward error |b-A*x| / (|A||x|n) : 5.880868e-17
```
